# Burger - > revised 1/27/2018

Burger is a project that uses sql and will link with either the local host or via Heroku.  It is intended to expand on the concept and deployment of MVC. 

In my model I needed to split out more routes via the orm and controllers but most of code ended up in the index.handlebars. 

**I will work on modulizing these. **
